        <h3 class="section-text__title">What is Wudu?</h3>
        <p class="section-text__body">
          Wudu, also known as ablution, is a purification process that Muslims perform before prayer. 
        </p>
        <p class="section-text__body">
          It involves the washing of specific body parts, symbolizing physical and spiritual cleansing. 
        <p class="section-text__body">
          Wudu is an essential prerequisite for Salah (prayer) as it prepares individuals to stand before Allah with a clean and focused state of
          mind.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text__body">
          See the <a href="" class="section-text__link">Wudu section</a> to learn how to perform Wudu before prayer.

        <h3 class="section-text__title">What is a Rakat?</h3>
        <p class="section-text__body">
          A Rakat refers to a unit of prayer. 
        </p>
        <p class="section-text__body">
          Each prayer consists of a specific number of Rakats, and the number varies depending on the type of prayer
          being offered.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text__body">
          Imagine you want to do pushups as a quick workout.
          You tell yourself you want to do 3 sets. 
        </p>
        <p class="section-text__body">
          Like a workout, your prayer has parts to it, called rakats. 
          A prayer usually has 2, 3, or 4 rakats, which are like the sets within the prayer.

        <h3 class="section-text__title">What is Du'a?</h3>
        <p class="section-text__body">
          Du'a, or "supplication" refers to the act of communicating with Allah (God) through personal prayers and heartfelt expressions.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text__body">
          Du'a is a means through which Muslims seek guidance, blessings, forgiveness, mercy, and assistance from Allah in various
          aspects of their lives. It is an intimate conversation between an individual and their Creator, allowing them to express
          their deepest desires, concerns, and gratitude.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text__body">
          Muslims are encouraged to make Du'a in times of joy, sorrow, need, and gratitude.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text__body">
          It can be performed in any language, as
          Allah understands all languages, but using Arabic phrases and verses from the Quran is highly recommended.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text__body">
          Du'a can be made at any time and in any place, and does not require a specific ritual or physical posture. 
          It can be performed silently or verbally, individually or in congregation, 
          and can range from a simple personal plea to a comprehensive supplication encompassing various aspects of life.
