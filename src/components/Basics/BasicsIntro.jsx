        This website is intended to cover the basics of the 5 daily prayers. 
        It is meant to be a resource for Muslims who are new to praying.
        Take it slow, and don't worry if you don't get everything right away.
        It might also help to start with just getting down the 2 rakat prayer (Fajr), since the 4 rakat prayers are basically like repeating the 2 rakat prayer.
